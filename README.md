# **TinyApp Project for Lighthouse Labs**

TinyApp is a full stack web application that allows users to create short urls that correspond to long(actual website) URLs (similar to bit.ly). TinyApp is built with Node and Express.

## Final Product

!["Screenshot of URLs page with no user logged in"]()


*User can sign up to create own shorten urls*

!["Screenshot of registration page"]()


*A user with a registered account can login using valid details*
!["Screenshot of login page"]()
